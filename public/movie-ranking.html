<h1>The Best Movies According to Naman</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Avengers Endgame</h3> 
<p>Exciting, entertaining, and emotionally impactful, Avengers: Endgame does whatever it takes to deliver a satisfying finale to Marvel's epic Infinity Saga.</p>

<h3>Avengers Infinity War</h3> 
<p>Iron Man, Thor, the Hulk and the rest of the Avengers unite to battle their most powerful enemy yet -- the evil Thanos. On a mission to collect all six Infinity Stones, Thanos plans to use the artifacts to inflict his twisted will on reality. The fate of the planet and existence itself has never been more uncertain as everything the Avengers have fought for has led up to this moment.</p>

<h3>Avatar</h3> 
<p>It might be more impressive on a technical level than as a piece of storytelling, but Avatar reaffirms James Cameron's singular gift for imaginative, absorbing filmmaking.</p>
